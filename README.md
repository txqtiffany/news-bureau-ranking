# News Bureau Performance Ranking Project in the EU Region

This project is designed to analyze and rank the performance of various internal bureaus in the EU region based on the number and level of honorable-mentioned articles they received in the year 2023.

The project involves processing a collection of Excel files containing data on honorable mentioned news articles categorized into three levels. Techniques such as text mining, data cleaning, and data transformation are employed to extract relevant information, including author names, editor names, and bureau affiliations from the articles.

After aggregating and analyzing this data, the project generates ranking sheets highlighting the performance of each bureau within the EU area. These rankings consider both the number and level of honorable-mentioned articles authored and edited by each bureau. 

The final output provides insights into the performance of EU bureaus in producing and editing notable news articles, aiding in evaluating the effectiveness and impact of each bureau in 2023 for the main EU office.
